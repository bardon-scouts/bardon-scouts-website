    Scouts is fun! Young people from 5 to 25 will make lots of friends while
    doing heaps of new things, some of them once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.
    Scouts engages and inspires young people to develop confidence, resilience
    and leadership. Our focus is on fun, and we make sure Scouts are ‘learning
    by doing.’ 


    Scouts is the worlds largest youth movement with over 28 million youth members.

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
